## What is Zero CSS

Zero CSS or `zero.css` is a modern approach to standardizing HTML elements and establishing a strong foundation for your web projects.

Considering the fast-moving world of the web, Zero CSS works as a working ground for your new projects where everything is basically zeroed-down for you to start making things from scratch.

It is currently in alpha stage, and is not recommended to use in production yet.

## What it offers

Zero CSS aims to provide a consistent look and feel across different web elements, inspired by influential projects like Meyer's Reset, HTML5 Reset, and Normalize CSS.

### Features

- Normalize HTML elements for consistency
- Establish a solid base for web projects
- Simplify the CSS part of the front-end design and development process
- Improve reliability and usability of websites

### Usage

To use Zero CSS in your project, simply include the provided CSS file in your HTML document:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="zero.css" />
```

Alternatively, not a recommended way though, you can import the Zero CSS stylesheet directly in your project like below:

```css
@import 'zero.css';
```

As soon as this project moves to beta, there will be an NPM package to provide regular as well as CSS modules that you could consume in your JavaScript apps.
