## What is Zero CSS

Zero CSS or `zero.css` simplifies the process of standardizing HTML elements and laying a solid groundwork for your web projects.

It offers a starting point for modern web projects, providing a quick and contemporary CSS reset. This eliminates the need for an initial setup, enabling you to start building from scratch without worrying about resetting defaults for various HTML elements.

Please note that Zero CSS is currently in the alpha stage and is not recommended for production use yet.

## What it offers

Zero CSS is designed to ensure a uniform appearance across various web elements, drawing inspiration from influential projects such as Meyer's Reset, HTML5 Reset, and Normalize CSS.

### Features

- Normalizes HTML elements for consistent appearance
- Establishes a sturdy foundation for web projects
- Save developers some time and effort 

### Using Zero CSS in your project

Include the provided `zero.css` file in your HTML document for straightforward integration:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="zero.css" />
```

While not ideal for long-term maintenance, another option is to use the CSS `@import` rule to include the zero stylesheet in your main CSS file. However, a better approach is to directly copy the entire CSS code and paste it into your main stylesheet.

For advanced JavaScript workflows, download the `zero.css` file, add it to your project, and use it as you would with your preferred frameworks.

If this project receives positive feedback, I plan to create an NPM package offering Regular and CSS Modules formats, making it easier to integrate with your JavaScript applications.
